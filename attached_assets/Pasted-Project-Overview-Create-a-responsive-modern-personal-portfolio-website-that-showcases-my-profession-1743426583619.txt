Use a color palette that is professional but distinctive (suggest 2-3 primary colors plus neutrals)
Implement responsive design that works well on mobile, tablet, and desktop screens
Include smooth animations and transitions for better user experience
Optimize loading times and performance

Important Notes
I'll be replacing placeholder images with actual photos later
The content should be populated from my attached resume
The contact form should be functional but can send to a placeholder email initially
Make sure the page works offline (implement basic service worker)

Please generate this complete website in a way that makes it easy for me to update and personalize after receiving the code.
